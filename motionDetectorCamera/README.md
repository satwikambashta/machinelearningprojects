The simple solution uses Google Pipeline's pose detection.
The complex does not use a ready model instead uses greyscale values and calculates contours.
An idea for someone who would like to use this source code is to make a website that can take API of security cameras that allow live remote broadcasts and run this model live on the website and inform the user of movement that happens in the time duration given by the user.
